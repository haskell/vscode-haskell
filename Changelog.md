## 1.8.0

This release includes some interesting new features:

- You can now pass custom environment variables to the lsp server
  with the `haskell.serverEnvironment` config option per project basis,
  thanks to [@jacobprudhomme](https://github.com/jacobprudhomme).
  - For example: `"haskell.serverEnvironment": { "XDG_CACHE_HOME": "/path/to/my/cache" }`
- With this version the extension will try to use the newer lsp server version
  which supports the ghc used by the project being loaded, thanks to [@mduerig](https://github.com/mduerig)
  - WARNING: This will suppose it will use an older version than the latest one,
    without its features and bug fixes.
- The extension has lot of more log traces now, which hopefully will help to
  identify the cause of issues

## 1.7.1

- Bug fix release due to #471 and fixed with #469 thanks to [@berberman](https://github.com/berberman)

## 1.7.0

- Add an option to set server command line arguments thanks to [@cdsmith](https://github.com/cdsmith) <https://github.com/haskell/vscode-haskell/pull/464>
  - It includes a new config option `haskell.serverExtraArgs` to being able to pass extra argument to the lsp server executable
- Update config options to match last haskell-language-server version <https://github.com/haskell/vscode-haskell/pull/463>
  - It removes `haskell.diagnosticsOnChange` and `haskell.formatOnImportOn` cause they were unused in the server
  - It adds `haskell.checkProject`, `haskell.maxCompletions` and `haskell.plugin.refineImports.globalOn`
- Fix showDocumentation command thanks to [@pranaysashank](https://github.com/pranaysashank) <https://github.com/haskell/vscode-haskell/pull/452>
  - It fixes partially showing the documentation directly in vscode. The documentation is rendered but internal links still does not work
  - Two config options has been added: `haskell.openDocumentationInHackage` and `haskell.openSourceInHackage` with default value `true`
    - So documentation will be opened using the hackage url in an external navigator by default
    - If you prefer having them in vscode you will need to change them to `false`
- Create output channel only if there are no existing clients thanks to [@pranaysashank](https://github.com/pranaysashank) <https://github.com/haskell/vscode-haskell/pull/448>
  - This fixes the creation of several output channels for the extension

## 1.6.1

- Fix wrapper call to get project ghc version in windows with spaces in path (<https://github.com/haskell/vscode-haskell/pull/439>)

## 1.6.0

- Bump up vscode version to 1.52.0 (#424) by [@berberman](https://github.com/berberman)
  - To match the lsp spec version used in haskell-language-version and fix <https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/issues/2068>

## 1.5.1

- Add much more logging in the client side, configured with `haskell.trace.client`
- Fix error handling of `working out project ghc` and a bug when the path to the executable contains spaces (See #421)
  - And dont use a shell to spawn the subprocess in non windows systems
  - Show the progress as a cancellable notification
- Add commands `Start Haskell LSP server` and `Stop Haskell LSP server`

## 1.5.0

- Emit warning about limited support for ghc-9.x on hls executable download
- Fix `working out project ghc` progress notificacion
- Fix tactics config, thanks to @isovector
- Update server config to match haskell-language-server-1.3.0 one

## 1.4.0

- Restore `resource` scope for `haskell.serverExecutablePath` temporary. The `machine` scope will be set again after giving users a period of time to let them adapt theirs workflows and changing or adding some option in the extension itself to help that adjustement (see #387).

## 1.3.0

- Add `haskell.releasesURL` option to override where to look for HLS releases search for HLS downloads, thanks to @soiamsoNG
- With this version _the only supported lsp server variant is [`haskell-language-server`](https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server)_
- Add support for generic plugin configuration. Thanks to it, each plugin capability (diagnostics, code actions, code lenses, etc) or the entire plugin can be disabled
- Add some plugin specic options:
  - [wingman](https://haskellwingman.dev/) (aka tactics) plugin
    - `haskell.plugin.tactic.config.features`: Feature set used by the plugin
    - `haskell.plugin.tactics.config.hole_severity`: The severity to use when showing hole diagnostics
    - `haskell.plugin.tactic.config.max_use_ctor_actions`: Maximum number of `Use constructor <x>` code actions that can appear
    - `haskell.plugin.tactics.config.timeout_duration`: The timeout for Wingman actions, in seconds
  - completions
    - `haskell.plugin.ghcide-completions.config.autoExtendOn`: Extends the import list automatically when completing a out-of-scope identifier
    - `haskell.plugin.ghcide-completions.config.snippetsOn`: Inserts snippets when using code completions
  - type signature lenses - `haskell.plugin.ghcide-type-lenses.config.mode`: Control how type lenses are shown
- The option `haskell.serverExecutablePath` has now `machine` scope, so it can be only changed globally by the user. It avoids a potential security vulnerability as folders containing `.vscode/settings.json` with that option could execute arbitrary programs.
- Deprecated options:
  - `haskell.hlintOn`: use `haskell.plugin.hlint.globalOn` instead.
  - `haskell.completionSnippetsOn`: use `haskell.plugin.ghcide-completions.config.snippetsOn`
- Fixed a small typo that caused the server not to be loaded in `.lhs` files, thanks to @Max7cd

## 1.2.0

- Add option to open local documentation on Hackage (@DunetsNM)

  (@WorldSEnder)

## 1.0.0

- Can now download zip archived binaries, which the Windows binaries are now distributed as
- Improve README (@pepeiborra @jaspervdj)

## 0.1.1

- Fix the restart server and import identifier commands

## 0.1.0

`vscode-hie-server`/`Haskell Language Server` is now just Haskell, and will soon
be published under the Haskell organisation as `haskell-vscode`.
This release makes haskell-language-server the default langauge server of choice
and automatically downloads and installs binaries. Installation from source is
still supported though and any binaries located on your PATH for the selected
langauge server will be used instead.

### Important!

As part of this, your configuration may be reset as the keys move from
`languageServerHaskell.completionSnippetsOn` to `haskell.completionSnippetsOn`.

  servers

  - HaRe commands
  - Case split commands

## 0.0.40
